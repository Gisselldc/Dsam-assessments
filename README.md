# Dsam-assessments
I'm going to remind myself that this is a work in progress. Not a good-bye, but maybe, see you never. Unless you know..... 
So, to introduce my project, one last time: 
  My project attempts to look compile a database of information gathered from schools regarding their placement assessment information. 
  To narrow the scope, I chose to look at colleges and universities within the continental U.S. that were commissioned by The Middle States Commission on Higher Education. 
  To find my data, I looked at each school's individual website and typed that information into a spreadsheet. 
  I compiled a list of all the schools names, websites, assessments listed on the site, the type of institution it was as defined by the Carnegie Classifications, the URL for the listed placement info, the type of assessment they used (I narrowed down the categories of assessment to: Standardized Placement Exam, Summative Assessment, Self - Placement, Transcripts, Concordant Assessments, College Readiness, and N/A ), I listed any assessment prep material advertised on the website, and then I looked for 3 Yes / No questions: Does the assessment page directly link accomodation info for these exams?; Are students able to retest?; Do ESL Students have a different assessment option?
  I ended the search of each school with the date I found this information. 



  When you look back at your initial goals, where have you ended up?
I'm not really sure. So, my initial goals were as follows: 
Is there a difference between 4 year universities and community college placement? 
Is the Accuplacer the prefered placement method? 
What is the ratio between formative assessments, and self-placement?
What are the potential impacts for non accessible placement methods info
Are there alternative options for students who are ELL 
How many schools just do not put placement info on their website in an easily accessible way?


I think I was able to answer most if not all of these questions. But, while I was compiling the data my research question changed, and I realized how little data I actually have, and although I'm very proud of my project, I fully acknowledge that the scale is actually too small to do any broad scale statements regarding the current state of placement assessment or like, broad trends. I'm not really sure if just critiquing the websites of universities that can change what they "advertise" on the website is useful. This is especially true when there's other, way larger projects being commissioned by the government to assess these things. 
I mean, I'm really proud of myself for using my past experiences to do a project like this, but not sure if I'll continue this particular project because the projects purpose no longer seems relevant. If I were to ever continue this project, it would be much more broad, and like a FULL project, and also instead of like, taking the information from websites, I'd send out a survey to admisssions people and not limit it to a particular commission. However, looking at this through like a failure lens, the amount of learns I learned this semester is really something. I'm really proud of the learns.
